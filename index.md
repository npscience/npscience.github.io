Welcome, explore my connected post-synaptic space. And reach out – perhaps we'd enjoy discussing and learning face-to-face.

# At the nucleus...

I believe in people and planet over profit.

I am enthused by delivering great experiences and events.

I coach, I question, I facilitate, I think, I strategise, I design, I create.

To try to improve the benefit of science to society, and share the wealth science creates, I currently work to advocate for/build/promote equitable knowledge processes and communication.

I am moved by injustice and inequality, humans facing hard times, mother earth, food and nutrition (I did a PhD on obesity and eating; my current curiosity is edible :bug: :cricket:)
