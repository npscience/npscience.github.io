# Hello

I'm building a home on the web. 

```
theme: jekyll-theme-midnight
title: Exocytosis
description: Where npscience unloads her musings and memories
```

If you've something to offer or reflect about this, please do so via the Issues. Feedback is welcome <3 and please do not send a pull request without chatting with me first.

# Acknowledgements

Danielle Robinson's site formed the template for Emmy Tsang to build the first draft of this site with contributions from Elsa Loissel. Toby Hodges rekindled my aspiration to do this. I've been watching and learning from many others too. Constant support and nudging has brought me to make this my own.

I'm starting with a simple theme: [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight), by pages-themes.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/npscience/npscience.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/npscience/npscience.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
