## My focus
- **Championing and supporting others** — including asking the right questions, but not necessarily evaluation or feedback; I’m a coach, not a referee. I am proud to be a mentor for Open Life Sciences.
- **Events that build community** — thinking about the people, what they need in order to engage with each other, be productive together,  feel part of something and welcomed. I love participating in well-organised communities like CSCCE and The Turing Way.
- **Providing information to help others** — finding things out and presenting the information for others to learn, understand and use. I'm good at finding out the details. To improve how I summarise it simply and elegantly for others, I am learning Service Design methodologies.
- **Strategy development** – I like understanding the landscape, the gaps, opportunities and priorities, and building a strategy from this. To flex my creative muscles, I practise improv comedy with a small troupe.
- **Equitable innovation** – I am focussing my learning on whether advances in some places offer advances to everyone, or to an already privileged subgroup. This is important to me because I am interested helping anyone to answer questions and make life better for themselves locally, and I prefer not to focus on national productivity or competitive advantages. Openness in science may be a way toward this goal, if implemented equitably, or designed for those with the greatest disadavantages in scholarship right now. To keep learning, I join book clubs and read/listen/watch.
